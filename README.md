# In-Vehicle_Coupon-recommendation
This data was collected through a survey conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey presented various driving scenarios, such as the destination, current time, weather, and passenger, and asked participants whether they would accept a coupon if they were the driver.

Performed extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and analyzed the data using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques. Additionally, applied various supervised machine learning algorithms and compared their performance using F1 score and AUC score as the key performance indicators (KPIs). At the end of our analysis, the catboost algorithm emerged as the best performer.
